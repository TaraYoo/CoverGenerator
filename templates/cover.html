	<p>Dear {{ Contact }}</p>
	<p>My name is Tara Yoo and I'm writing to apply to {{JobName}}.
	{% if Referred%}
		I heard about the position from {{Referral}} who encouraged me to apply.
	{% endif %}
	I am a Massachusetts CPA with experience in Python, Flask web apps, VBA, SQL, and Bootstrap. I excelled at learning new technologies, automating processes, and providing technical support to my team in my previous roles. I would bring the same attention to detail and ability to learn to this role.</p>
	<p>In my previous roles as Tax Accountant, I constantly taught myself new accounting processes, tax laws, and technology against tight deadlines and minimal guidance. I often finished my projects earlier than expected by automating key steps.<br>At EY, I leveraged advanced Excel formulas and VBA to clean up and analyze 5000+ sales invoice data to project clientsâ€™ sales and use tax liabilities. These sales and use tax projects involved legal research to determine taxability of different types of assets, data consolidation, clean up, and analysis. I automated data aggregation by using the command line to merge csv files and taught other staff how to do the same. At Global Atlantic, I decreased the time needed for the process by 50% by automating pdf page extraction through VBA. I also identified an additional $20,000 in Foreign Tax Credits using the time I saved.</p>
	<p>Outside of work, I worked on personal projects such as
		{{Projects[0].name}} using {{Projects[0].tech}}
		{%if Projects|length>1%}
			and {{Projects[1].name}} using {{Projects[1].tech}}
		{%endif%}
	</p>
	<p>{{Reason}}</p>
	<p>My resume and references are attached. You can reach me at any time via email at yootar@gmail.com or via my cell phone, 413-695-9086. Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to speaking with you.</p>
	<p>Sincerely,</p>
	<p>Tara Yoo	</p>
